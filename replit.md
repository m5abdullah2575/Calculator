## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: Built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any frontend frameworks
- **Responsive Design**: Uses Tailwind CSS via CDN for consistent, mobile-first responsive styling
- **Component-Based Structure**: Individual calculator tools are organized as separate cards/components within the main HTML file
- **Search-Driven Interface**: Central search functionality allows users to filter and find specific tools quickly

### Styling and UI Framework
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework loaded via CDN for rapid UI development
- **Feather Icons**: Lightweight icon library for consistent iconography throughout the interface
- **Custom CSS**: Supplementary styles for animations, transitions, and tool-specific formatting
- **Card-Based Layout**: Each tool is presented in its own card with hover effects and clear visual hierarchy

### JavaScript Architecture
- **Modular Functions**: Each calculator/converter tool has dedicated JavaScript functions
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive input validation and error display system
- **Real-Time Calculations**: Immediate result updates as users input data
- **Search Functionality**: Dynamic filtering of tools based on user search queries

### Data Handling
- **Client-Side Only**: All calculations and conversions are performed entirely in the browser
- **No Persistence**: No data storage or user session management (stateless)
- **Input Validation**: Robust validation for all numeric inputs and form fields

## External Dependencies

### CDN Libraries
